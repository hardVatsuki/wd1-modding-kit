# About
Simple tool for modders that supports converting XBT <> DDS, SBAO <> OGG, Save <> SAV, FEU <> GFX.

You can drop individual file(s) or whole folders. If you run program without dragging a file/folder, you can convert files by putting them into Input folder near exe. To get help run program with -? or --help parameters. Tell me if you find any bugs, but be sure that files you are putting are not broken already. For converting dds and ogg back to xbt and sbao you need a header file which you get if you convert the file(s) with my tool first. If you save a new file which can be an edit of converted file, you need to copy header from the file your new file based on and rename it as yours file. Header is additional information for the game and all files having their own unique header.
